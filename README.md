## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the data set I found that trip length depend on both start time of the trip and type of user, since people tend to take longer trips on the weekends  than they do on weekdays, also trips taken in the miday and evening periods are mostly longer than other periods. As for months trips on the springs and the summer are longer. For the user type most of the times customers take a lot longer trips than subscribers.
